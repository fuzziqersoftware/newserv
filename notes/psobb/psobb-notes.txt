SCHTSERV Drop Tables Data EP1/EP2/EP4

The Item files included in this folder are the final ones I've created for 
Schtserv with the latest revision update October 31st 2022, these files includes
the revised Drop Rate data for all the enemies in the game across all Difficulties
and Episodes, including the special items added in the final PSOBB official patch 
(1.25.13) which affects some of the Episode 1 and Episode 2 Bosses drops in Very Hard 
and Ultimate and specially a mostly complete official implementation of the Episode 4
bosses and enemies for all Section ID's.

However, as I'm not sure if the implementation of the rare drop logic from this
server vs the one we had on Schtserv will allow a simple file replace without breaking
anything, I'm leaving the raw files here for whoever wants to properly implement them 
over here.

By using these files you will ensure you have a PSOBB experience as close as possible
to the original game, at least on the rare item drop side of things which is a big part 
of the main game loop regardless.

P.D: It might still be necessary to verify the PMT file for normal item drops in the 
Episode 4 areas, Shops and Challenge Mode
