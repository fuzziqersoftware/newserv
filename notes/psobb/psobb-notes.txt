PSOBB Support files, notes and resources

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLIENT LOCALIZATION

By default PSOBB loads everything in Japanese so it requires some extra files
to properly implement the English localization from SOA, these files are offered
here inside the usbb-resources folder for your convenience.

To use them you just need to drag and drop all its contents into your client's 
data folder. Then if the client's internal lang flag is set correctly to English 
will load all the correct texts from these files.

In case you want to play in Japanese, just use the default Tethealla client and 
delete all the files including _e or _eng in the names and then the game will 
default everything to its original Japanese language.

Just in case, there's the jpbb-resources folder with the latest localization 
changes made on the official JPBB for an extra backup.

PSOBB EP1,2,4 ORIGINAL VANILLA DROP TABLES/RATES

Included in the vanilla-tables folder I placed the original files I created for the
Schtserv vanilla for backup purposes as they are already implemented into the main
newserv logic. 

These tables will offer you the experience as close as possible to the original SEGA
servers for PSOBB JP up to the latest patch before the servers shutdown, so besides a 
fully functional Episode IV experience, the tables also include the latest special items
which where added to some Episode 1 and Episode 2 in Ultimate for certain section ID's

Vanilla Tables and rates are the same ones as the Schtserv Wiki for reference:
