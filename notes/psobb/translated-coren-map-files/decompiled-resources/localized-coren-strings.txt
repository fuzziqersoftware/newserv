presentation:

I am Coren Tsu, a wandering merchant,
you could say.

Please take some time to look at
the rare and wonderous goods
I have been collecting.

If you spend a little meseta,
you could win a wonderful prize.

Well? Wanna try?


You may win,
you may lose.

But if you don't win,
don't take it out on me.

That's just the way
gambling is, yes?

Well then, how much
meseta do you want to pay?

As long as you pay me,
I'll give you a great service.


Huh?

That's too bad...

Well, these kind of things usually
have a chance to lose money.

Let's keep this discreet.
If you feel up to it, talk to me again.


It seems you have
too many items.

First, go and
organize your items,

Then speak to me again.

What?

You said you'd try,
then you said no.

People like that
fail at everything.


What the...?

You don't have the
meseta to pay me?

I won't work with such
cold hearted people.


Alright, let's do it.

You better pray
for something good...


Look here!
Take it!

Even if you had bad luck,
something good will come out of it.

You'll win someday!

In case you want to try again,
come back to me once more.
