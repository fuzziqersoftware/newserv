  // This configuration file is used when replaying tests. It mostly matches the
  // configuration file fuzziqersoftware uses while developing, with a few
  // relevant differences:
  // 1. The LocalAddress and ExternalAddress are both set to en0, since the
  //    replay runner uses virtual connections instead.
  // 2. The IP stack simulator is disabled.
  // 3. Unregistered users are allowed. This enables the tests to run on other
  //    machines, which won't have the same license file.
