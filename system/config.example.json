  // the JSON standard are also supported; notably, integers may be specified in
  // hexadecimal using the 0x prefix. If you use a text editor that auto-formats
  // JSON on save, it may be confused by this file's format. Make sure it
  // doesn't automatically turn hex integers into strings, for example.

  // If you're just setting up a newserv instance for your personal use, you
  // probably only need to change LocalAddress. Set LocalAddress to your
  // machine's local IPv4 address (usually something like 10.0.x.x or
  // 192.168.x.x). In PSO's network configuration, set the DNS server address to
  // the same address you entered in LocalAddress in this file.

  // If you also want people to be able to connect to your newserv instance from
  // the Internet, you'll need to set ExternalAddress to your public-facing IPv4
  // address (you can find this by visiting e.g. whatismyip.com). You'll also
  // need to set up port forwarding on your router for all the TCP ports listed
  // in PortConfiguration (9000, 9001, etc.), as well as UDP port 53. Players
  // from outside your network can then connect to your server by entering your
  // public address as their DNS server address in PSO's network configuration.
