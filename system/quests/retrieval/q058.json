  // Each quest may have an optional JSON file (like this one) that defines
  // server-side behaviors for the quest.

  // Quests may be set to be unavailable until a preceding quest has been
  // cleared or a team reward has been purchased. To enable this behavior, set
  // a value for AvailableIf in the quest's JSON file. (This is ignored if the
  // player has the DISABLE_QUEST_REQUIREMENTS flag in their account.) This
  // field's value should be an expression that tests any of the following:
  //   F_XXXX: Quest flag specified in hex (e.g. F_014D)
  //   CC_EpX_Y: Whether or not Challenge stage X in Episode Y is complete
  //   T_ZZZ: Whether or not the player's BB team has reward ZZZ
  //   V_NumPlayers: The number of players in the current game
  //   V_Event: The holiday event in the current game
  //   V_V1Present: Whether there are any V1 players in the current game
  // You can also use constants, parentheses, and many common integer and
  // boolean operators. An example expression with random values is shown here.
  // "AvailableIf": "(F_016D || T_MyCustomQuest || (V_NumPlayers <= 2)) && !F_0173",

  // On BB, quests may be disabled but still visible to the player. This
  // expression controls when that should be the case. If AvailableIf evaluates
  // to false, this is ignored. This field is also ignored if the player has
  // the DISABLE_QUEST_REQUIREMENTS flag in their account.
  // "EnabledIf": "!F_0169",

  // On BB, a quest's joinability flag is part of the quest file header, but
  // other versions don't natively support joining quests in progress. This
  // flag, if present, enables non-BB quests to be joined when already in
  // progress. Note that this will likely not work properly unless the quest
  // script is designed to support joining players.
  // "Joinable": true,

  // If a quest is joinable and this field is specified, then setting this
  // register to a nonzero value via the sync_register opcode will cause the
  // game to be locked and not allow any further joins. If the register is set
  // to zero again, joining will be allowed again. This field is ignored for
  // quests that do not have the Joinable option set above.
  // "LockStatusRegister": 249,

  // Normally, the $quest command requires $debug to be enabled, but if this
  // option is set, this quest may be loaded via $quest even if $debug is off
  // if there are no other players present in the game. When a quest is loaded
  // via $quest, AvailableIf and EnabledIf are not checked, so it's inadvisable
  // to use this option if either of those options are also used.
  // "AllowStartFromChatCommand": true,

  // If this field is specified, it overrides the default common item table for
  // the duration of the quest. The common item table name must begin with
  // either "common-table-" or "ItemPT-", and the corresponding file should be
  // in system/item-tables/ and should be in .json, .afs, .gsl, or .gslb
  // format. The file extension (.json, etc.) should not be included here. If
  // you use this, make sure to set AllowedDropModes appropriately below.
  // "CommonItemSetName": "common-table-custom1",

  // If this field is specified, it overrides the default rare item table for
  // the duration of the quest. The rare item table name must begin with either
  // "rare-table-" or "ItemRT-". As for common item sets, the rare table must
  // be in system/item-tables/. If it's in JSON format, the table name must end
  // with -v1, -v2, -v3, or -v4. If you use this, make sure to set
  // AllowedDropModes appropriately below.
  // "RareItemSetName": "rare-table-custom1",

  // If these fields are specified, they override the allowed drop modes and
  // the default drop mode for the game when the quest is loaded. These
  // function analogously to the drop mode fields in config.json; see the
  // comments there for more information. If a custom common or rare table is
  // also specified above, the client drop mode should be disallowed here (by
  // clearing the 0x02 bit of AllowedDropModes).
  // "AllowedDropModes": 0x1D,
  // "DefaultDropMode": "SERVER_PRIVATE",
